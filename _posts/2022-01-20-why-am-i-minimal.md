Because it's a f###ing perfect website.

Seriously, it takes minimal effort to improve this shit.

## 7 declarations.

That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:

- this 'garbage' support rtl and ltr with almost zero effort
- Shit's still lightweight and loads fast
- Still fits on all your shitty screens
- Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers
- The MFer's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site
- Shit's still legible and gets your point across

## And guess what, MFer:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.

Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

If your text hits the side of the browser, f### off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.

## A little less contrast

Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 lines.

## Size Matters

I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.

## Line-width, MFer

Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 F###ing characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
Yes, this is also satire, you f### 

I love what the creator of this [site's](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) inspiration did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
